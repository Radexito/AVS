# AVS - Analog Vinyl System
This application is specifically crafted to assist novice DJs in their journey of mixing by utilizing authentic vinyl 
records, similar to DVS (Digital Vinyl System). Instead of employing timecode vinyls, it functions by streaming audio 
from multiple vinyl decks using genuine vinyl records. The program showcases the waveform and BPM (beats per minute), 
providing users with visual guidance throughout the process. 

To capture the output from each deck, an audio interface or USB mixer is necessary.

# Features:
Display waveform for each deck.
Display BPM for each deck.
